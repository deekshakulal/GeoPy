# GeoPy
  The python database course project which selects the random places from the map database and also I manually included a specific location, displays the map. Using the Google Places API with a Database and Visualizing Data on Google Map. In this project, we are using the Google geocoding API to clean up some user-entered geographic locations of university names and then placing the data on a Google Map.
  Simply open where.html in a browser to see the locations. You can hover over each map pin to find the location that the gecoding API returned for the user-entered input.
